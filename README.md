# hindi-pluralization-model-comparision
This project focuses on training CRF and LSTM models to predict plural forms in Hindi. Hindi has a high morphological inflection system, and pluralization is an important part of it. These techniques help us study how Hindi words change when forming plurals, allowing computers to pro- cess the language more effectively.
